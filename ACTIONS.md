# Actions to take for every step in the implementation plan

The document `PLAN.md` outlines a systematic approach to **document and visualize** my existing Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) workflow. This project creates a Python application to map out which tools I use for different information types, and which steps I follow when processing information through my four-phase workflow (Collect ‚Üí Retrieve ‚Üí Consume ‚Üí Refine).

**Important:** This is NOT building a PKM system itself - it's building a documentation and visualization tool to understand and optimize my existing PKM workflow.
