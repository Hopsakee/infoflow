But `SQLite` only has datatypes: `NULL`, `INTEGER`, `REAL`, `TEXT`, and `BLOB`. So no `list` or any of the Dataclass(Enum) types we use.\n",

    "To be able to use both `Pydanctic` and the `MiniDataAPI` we will do two things:\n",

    "1. Define a Pydantic Dataclass with the correct datatypes and a Dataclass that has the same fields as the Pydantic Dataclass, but with datatypes that can be used with SQLite.\n",

    "3. We also use the `@field_validator` decorator to convert the JSON strings back to the correct datatypes when we load the data from the SQLite database back into the Pydantic Dataclass.\n",
