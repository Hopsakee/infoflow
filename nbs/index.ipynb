    "I created this project because I want a personal knowledge management system to efficiently collect, organize, and retrieve information from various sources (books, articles, videos, podcasts, research papers, etc.). I usually can't immediately consume the information I encounter. By building a clear workflow of actions and tools I use to solve the problem of having more interesting information than I can process. By creating a structured four-phase workflow (Collect, Retrieve, Consume, Refine) I aim to make it as easy and fast as possible to store items when I encounter them and later find relevant information when I need it based on my current interests or projects.\n",
