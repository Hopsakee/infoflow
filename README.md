## User Guide

#### Intention of this project

I created this project because I want a personal knowledge management
system to efficiently collect, organize, and retrieve information from
various sources (books, articles, videos, podcasts, research papers,
etc.). I usually can’t immediately consume the information I encounter.
By building a clear workflow of actions and tools I use to solve the
problem of having more interesting information than I can process. By
creating a structured four-phase workflow (Collect, Retrieve, Consume,
Refine) I aim to make it as easy and fast as possible to store items
when I encounter them and later find relevant information when I need it
based on my current interests or projects.

I want to implement this as Python classes and visualize it with
Graphviz because this approach provides flexibility to easily modify
tools and processes, unlike static text or diagram-based approaches.
