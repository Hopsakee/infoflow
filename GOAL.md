## Introduction

I want you to help me think about how I can **process information in a structured way**. I often encounter more interesting information than I will ever be able to read—books, articles, research papers, YouTube videos, and podcasts. I want to develop a workflow to **collect and process all this information efficiently**.

---

## The Challenge

I receive information in many forms:
- **Book recommendations by friends**
- **Websites I come across**
- **Podcasts I want to listen to**
- **YouTube videos**
- **Research papers mentioned in courses**
- **Software programs, coding languages, and coding tricks**  
  (that I might want to try in the future or might need for a project)

My goal is to **save all these potentially interesting things** in such a way that I can find them easily—especially when I start a new project or want to explore a current interest.

## My Current Tools

I use several programs to collect and save information:
- [LibraryThing](https://librarything.com)
- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)
- [Recall by getrecall.ai](https://getrecall.ai)
- [Readwise.io](https://readwise.io)
- [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read)
- [Snipd](https://snipd.com) (for listening to podcasts)


## The Workflow I Want to Create

I want to create a workflow with you so that **it is clear where I should store a piece of information when I come across it**. My workflow should consist of four phases:

### 1. **Collect Phase**
- This phase is about coming across information and quickly storing it in the right "bucket" (i.e., the right tool or program).
- Storing should be as effortless as possible but also organized so I can find the information later.

### 2. **Retrieve Phase**
- In this phase, I look for valuable information in my personal knowledge management system.
- I want to be able to retrieve items based on my current interests or projects. For example:
  - How should we read the Bible book Genesis?
  - How does quantum mechanics work?
  - Why is there such a shortage in affordable houses?
- Usually, I have a list of 5–7 things that interest me at any given time.

### 3. **Consume Phase**
- Here, I read, watch, listen to, or experiment with the things I retrieved.
- I will likely make notes while doing this, and the note-taking process should be easy and effortless.
- Notes should be stored in a way that fits seamlessly into my system.

### 4. **Refine Phase**
- In this phase, I process all my notes and highlights from the consume phase.
- I use them to link notes, enrich items in my knowledge base, or even write new notes.
- This is also where I might connect related information and reflect on what I've learned.

## Implementation Approach

- I want to build this **personal knowledge management system using Python classes** for the relevant elements.
- I will then use the **Python package Graphviz to visualize the workflow**.
- The reason I want to process it this way is that **it makes the whole system very flexible**. I can easily add or switch tools or process steps.
- If I were to use a Mermaid diagram or just explain it all in text, it would be far less flexible and harder to spot gaps in my process.

Based on my analysis of your current PKM documents and the goal you've described, here's a comprehensive assessment:

## What I've Already Tried and What Worked/Didn't Work

This is a summary of what I've already tried and what worked/didn't work. We should prevent this from happening again.

**What Worked:**
- Using Obsidian as central hub with linking capabilities
- The Barbell method for progressive summarization to avoid over-processing content
- Tool integration: Readwise → Obsidian workflow for highlights and notes
- Separating tools by purpose rather than trying to make one tool do everything
- Clear distinction between capture (bookmarks) and processing phases
- Four-step workflow: find → select → read → process

**What Didn't Work:**
- Tool complexity: "het is niet makkelijk om het makkelijk te maken"
- Keeping reading status in multiple places (Boox vs LibraryThing confusion)
- Annotation sync issues between different tools (Neo Reader → Readwise problems)
- Over-processing: "Lees niet te veel. Wat je gelezen hebt verwerken, is ook leuk en minstens zo leerzaam"
- Inconsistent workflow execution leading to scattered information

## How My Current Goal Improves on Previous Attempts

**Improvements:**
1. **Systematic Approach**: Your Python class + Graphviz visualization approach addresses the flexibility issue you identified
2. **Clear Phase Separation**: The 4-phase system (Collect → Retrieve → Consume → Refine) builds on your existing workflow but makes it more systematic
3. **Tool Agnostic**: By modeling the process rather than the tools, you can adapt when tools change
4. **Project-Based Retrieval**: Your focus on retrieving based on current interests/projects addresses the "finding things when needed" problem

**Where It Falls Short:**
1. **Doesn't Address Tool Complexity**: You still have the same complex tool chain that caused friction before
2. **Missing Habit Formation**: No clear mechanism to ensure consistent execution
3. **Lacks Filtering Strategy**: You mention getting more information than you can process, but the new system doesn't address selection criteria
