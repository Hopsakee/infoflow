Should we do that in the SQLite database or in the Pydantic model or as a seperate function or yet another sollution. First think of different good coding practice approaches that are feasable. Next compare those approaches. When comparing take into account @[.windsurf/rules/code-style-guide.md] , @[.windsurf/rules/code-style-guide-fastai.md] , @[aicontext/fasthtml.md] ."

      "content": "**Approach Options**\n\n1. **SQLite unique indexes**\n   - *Pros*: guarantees integrity even outside the app.\n   - *Cons*: requires migrating existing tables; `dataset`-style helpers don’t expose unique constraints directly, so we’d need custom SQL per table and to touch the auto-generated schema. That conflicts with “iterate on existing patterns” and adds migration complexity.\n\n2. **Pydantic validators on the models**\n   - *Pros*: keeps validation near the data definition.\n   - *Cons*: models don’t own a database handle, so they’d need global access or extra parameters. Validation would have to run before `_instances` is populated, otherwise duplicates silently overwrite entries. This would tangle concerns and breaks the simple nbdev-generated notebooks.\n\n3. **Form-handler validation with a shared helper (recommended)**\n   - *Pros*: small change that reuses existing `db.t.<table>` access, keeps nbdev notebooks straightforward, and lets us surface the exact user-facing error required by the issue. We can create one helper (e.g. `ensure_unique_slug(db, table, slug, current_id=None)`) to avoid duplication while staying in fast.ai’s concise style.\n   - *Cons*: doesn’t prevent accidental duplicate inserts run outside the app, but that’s acceptable for the current workflow.\n\n4. **Pydantic + handler combo**\n   - Adds both runtime complexity and duplication of checks, so not aligned with “prefer simple solutions”.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nFollow option **3**: add a single helper that checks slug uniqueness for the relevant table (Tools, InformationItems, Improvements), call it in `tool_save`, `resource_save`, and `_save_improvement` before writing, and return the prescribed message on conflict. This respects the fast.ai style guide, keeps nbdev notebooks clean, and avoids schema churn while still delivering immediate user feedback.",
