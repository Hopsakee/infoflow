- Use `uv` for package management and environment management.
- Work in small steps. Only adjust one feature or solve one bug at a time.
- Always use a branch when building a feature or solving an issue.
- Use the `answer.ai` coding style.
- Use the `nbdev` coding approach, so use Jupyter Notebooks and do not use the python files.
- Write tests using the `fastcore.test` module from `fastcore`.
- If there are several good solutions or implemenations, explain why you chose the implemented option over the other options.
